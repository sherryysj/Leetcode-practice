# LeetCode-practice

Personal solutions for LeetCode problems.

## Catalogue

Problems are categorized by **type (Algorithms and Database)**, **study plan** or **Difficulty**, and **problem link** is in each problem's readme file.
In each problem, **multiple languages** are used to solve it, while in each language solution file, **multiple solutions** implemented by different techniques may be included.

### Algorithms

Using **Java**, **Python3**, **C#** and **Javascript** to solve in each problem, with readme file to compare the running time and memory for these languages and different techniques.

### Database

Using **Oracle SQL**, **MySQL**, **Microsoft SQL Server** to solve in each problem, with readme file to compare the running time for these languages and different techniques.

### Specification

The **running time** and **memory** vary because of machine used and account subscription, so I just use it to compare the difference among languages.
